# Who created it?
### 此提示词完全由我自己编写，而这也是个偶然。大家可以积极修改它，是它更加完美。也可以去引用它。但我并不希望有人盗走我的成果却说成自己的，所以有能力可以稍微提及一下或标注一下我；如果没能力，可以不用提及或标注，但不要说是自己创造的，谢谢。
> This prompt is entirely written by myself, and this is also an accident. You can actively modify it to make it more perfect. You can also quote it. But I don't want someone to steal my work and say it's my own. So if you have the ability, you can mention or mark me a little. If you don't have the ability, you don't have to mention or mark it, but don't say it's your own creation. Thank you.
